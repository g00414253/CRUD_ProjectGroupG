Our project uses a Menu class , to facilitate user interaction
via a Command line interface (CLI) this class acts as the main application.

The project then has interface "CRUD_OPERATIONS" which the classes "Admin" &
 "User" implement to interact with database in different ways.

Then there are the classes that handle the functions for the user menu
these are  "RepMax","BMRCalculator" & "WorkoutRecorder".

The last remaining class is "InputUtils" this which handles all CLI functions,
to ensure accurate user input handling. This class is essential due to
our project reliance on user inputs.

Project also includes a testing folder which contains all the files to test the CRUD operations
for MySQL.
